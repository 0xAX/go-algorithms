// recursion is a programming technique using function or

// is processed from the last one called to the first.

//If the size of the array is zero then, return -1,
//representing that the element is not found. This can also be treated as the base condition of a recursion call
//Otherwise, check if the element at the current index in the array is equal to the key or not i.e, arr[size â€“ 1] == key
//If equal, then return the index of the found key
